# Generated brand assets

The Expo tooling generates `icon.png`, `adaptive-icon.png`, and `splash.png` in this folder at build time via `ensureBrandAssets()`. These binaries are ignored from source control to keep the repository text-only. Run `npx expo prebuild` (or any Expo command that evaluates `app.config.ts`, such as `npm run start`) to regenerate them locally when needed.
