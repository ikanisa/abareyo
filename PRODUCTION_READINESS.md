## Critical Fixes Applied in This PR

1. **Build System**:
   - Fixed "use server" directive violations by extracting error classes
   - Fixed cron-parser API compatibility (parseExpression → parse)
   - Removed dependency on next-axiom with fallback implementation
   - Updated Docker configuration to work with Next.js build output

2. **Security**:
   - Resolved moderate vite vulnerability
   - Updated fast-redact/pino packages
   - Remaining 8 low-severity issues are in @lhci/cli (dev-only tool)

3. **Configuration**:
   - Added all required environment variables to K8s manifests
   - Added resource limits and requests
   - Configured TLS for production ingress
   - Added rate limiting and body size limits

4. **Testing**:
   - All 94 unit tests passing
   - Linting passes with no errors
   - Type checking passes
   - Build succeeds

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Create .env.production.local with actual values (use .env.production.example as template)
# 2. Generate secure secrets:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# 3. Verify environment:
npm run ci:check-env
```

### 2. Build & Test Locally
```bash
# Build frontend
npm run build

# Build backend (in backend/ directory)
cd backend
npm ci
npm run build
npm run prisma:generate
```

### 3. Deploy to Kubernetes
```bash
# Follow the complete guide in k8s/README.md

# Key steps:
# 1. Create namespace
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml

# 2. Create secrets (see k8s/README.md for commands)

# 3. Apply deployments
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml

# 4. Update and apply ingress
# Edit k8s/ingress.yaml first, then:
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n rayon

# Test backend health
kubectl run -n rayon curl --image=curlimages/curl:8.8.0 -i --rm --restart=Never -- \
  curl -fsS http://backend:5000/api/health

# Check logs
kubectl logs -n rayon deployment/backend --tail=50
kubectl logs -n rayon deployment/frontend --tail=50

# Access via ingress (after DNS configured)
curl -I https://your-domain.com
```

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

1. **Immediate (first 24 hours)**:
   - Monitor error rates in Sentry
   - Check pod restarts: `kubectl get pods -n rayon -w`
   - Verify health endpoints respond
   - Test critical user flows

2. **First Week**:
   - Monitor resource usage and adjust limits if needed
   - Review Prometheus metrics and alerts
   - Check for memory leaks or OOM kills
   - Verify backup procedures work

3. **Ongoing**:
   - Review security scan results weekly
   - Update dependencies monthly
   - Rotate secrets quarterly
   - Review and update documentation

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise after deployment:

```bash
# 1. Rollback to previous image version
kubectl set image deployment/frontend frontend=ghcr.io/ikanisa/abareyo-frontend:<previous-sha> -n rayon
kubectl set image deployment/backend backend=ghcr.io/ikanisa/abareyo-backend:<previous-sha> -n rayon

# 2. Verify rollback
kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend -n rayon
kubectl rollout status deployment/backend -n rayon

# 3. If database migrations were run, may need to restore DB backup
# See docs/runbooks/rollback.md for detailed procedures
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Next.js Standalone Output**: Current setup uses `next start` instead of standalone server.js due to output generation issue (possibly related to Sentry wrapper or i18n config). This works but uses slightly more memory. Future work could investigate and optimize.

2. **Remaining Low Vulnerabilities**: 8 low-severity vulnerabilities remain in @lhci/cli (Lighthouse CI), a dev-only PWA auditing tool. These do not affect production runtime.

3. **Static Export for Some Routes**: Some API routes show prerender warnings during build. This is expected for dynamic routes and doesn't affect functionality.

## Support & Troubleshooting

- **Documentation**: See `docs/runbooks/` for operational guides
- **Issues**: Check existing issues or create new ones on GitHub
- **Logs**: Always check pod logs first: `kubectl logs -n rayon <pod-name>`
- **Health**: Use `/api/health` endpoint for backend, `/` for frontend
- **Metrics**: Access `/metrics` with Bearer token for detailed metrics
