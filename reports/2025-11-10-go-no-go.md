# 2025-11-10 Go/No-Go Review — Sandbox Attempt

- **Timestamp (UTC)**: 2025-11-10T15:13:49Z
- **Coordinator**: ChatGPT (OpenAI assistant) — sandbox operator
- **Release Scope**: Web PWA, admin portal, and mobile clients deployment to production
- **Decision**: ❌ Blocked — go/no-go review could not be held in sandbox

## Attendance
- Product Owner: _Pending (requires real stakeholder participation)_
- Engineering Lead: _Pending_
- QA Lead: _Pending_
- SRE / DevOps: _Pending_
- Support / Success: _Pending_

## Evidence Status
- Regression suites (web PWA, admin, mobile): **Not executed** — staging services and device labs unavailable
- Load/performance test results: **Not executed** — staging endpoints inaccessible from sandbox
- Observability review (Sentry, Prometheus, Grafana): **Not reviewed** — credentials and VPN access required
- Deployment dry run & rollback rehearsal: **Not executed** — CI/CD pipeline, registry, and cluster access missing
- Risk assessment & mitigation plan: **Drafted in prior docs; requires validation with stakeholders**

## Required Follow-Ups
1. Provide sandbox operator with temporary staging credentials or pair with an engineer who has access.
2. Schedule live regression and load testing sessions; capture logs, metrics, and screenshots for upload to `reports/`.
3. Share observability dashboards or grant read-only access for anomaly review prior to go-live.
4. Convene go/no-go meeting with stakeholders listed above; record decision, meeting notes, and links to evidence bundles.
5. Execute deployment and rollback rehearsal in a controlled window; attach CLI transcripts and monitoring snapshots.
