# Gikundiro.com QA Summary

This document captures a manual walkthrough of the public fan application at [gikundiro.com](https://gikundiro.com). Testing was performed with a text-based browser to verify navigation coverage, page rendering, and missing implementations or 404 errors across the experience.

## Home & Primary Navigation
- Home page renders the featured fixture (Rayon vs APR) with prominent **Buy Ticket** and **Match Centre** CTAs, plus quick links for Tickets, Shop, Services, and Rewards.
- Bottom navigation successfully routes to Home, Matches, Tickets, Shop, and More without broken links.
- Quick Actions tiles route correctly; `/services` hub loads but its child routes fail (see Services section).

## Tickets, Matches, & Matchday
- `/tickets` loads with "Upcoming Matches" header and gracefully handles empty fixtures.
- `/matches` lists fixtures (APR FC, Gicumbi FC, etc.) with kickoff details and working ticket CTAs that deep link to event-specific ticket pages (e.g., `/tickets/rayon-gicumbi`).
- Ticket detail pages render category sections (Quick Actions, Stories, Live Match Centre) but some content relies on live data and appears as skeletons when unavailable.
- `/matchday` presents live match centre features (stream, highlights, timeline, statistics, line-ups, chat). Interactive modules were not verifiable via text browser but page loads successfully.

## Shop & Cart
- `/shop` lists merchandise with name, category, and price. Product detail pages (e.g., `/shop/home-jersey-24-25`) show descriptions, sizes, price, and payment guidance.
- `/cart` renders with an empty-state message and USSD payment instructions, linking back to the shop.
- USSD purchase flows cannot be validated without a phone but UI does not surface errors.

## More Menu, Wallet, & Services
- `/more` aggregates Wallet & Passes, Rewards, Insurance & Savings, and Settings links.
- `/more/wallet` shows active/used tickets; `/wallet`, `/wallet/top-up`, and `/wallet/history` load with lookup tools, top-up instructions, and history stub respectively.
- `/more/rewards` remains in a perpetual loading state, implying a failing data fetch; users cannot review rewards.
- `/services` hub loads two tiles (Insurance, Savings) but `/services/insurance` and `/services/savings` both return 404 errors.

## Membership & Profile
- `/membership` exposes manual UUID entry, tier selection, and mobile money network fields; upgrade CTA opens `/membership/upgrade` with Fan, Gold, and Platinum plans.
- `/profile` surfaces supporter profile with dashboard and settings links (dashboard returns to `/more`, settings routes to `/settings`).
- Subscription CTAs report "0 plans" indicating incomplete backend wiring.

## Settings, Support, & Legal
- `/more/settings` lists language, theme, and notification options but only **Help & Legal** is interactive.
- `/support` lacks hotline/email details despite expectation in UX copy.
- `/settings` overview routes back to dashboard and `About this app`; `/settings/about` links to Privacy Policy and Terms, both implemented and containing contact info.

## Community, Fundraising, & Events
- `/community` loads leaderboards, fan feed, badges, and "Start a chant" CTA. `/community/missions` returns 404.
- `/fundraising` page renders section headers but lacks actual campaign content.
- `/events` lists upcoming club events with ticket purchase and calendar links; `/tickets/transfer` flow is present with initiate and claim steps.
- `/gate` gate-check tool loads with manual token entry and scanning prompts.

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Rewards data gap** – `/more/rewards` never resolves, preventing users from viewing rewards.
2. **Services hub dead links** – `/services/insurance` and `/services/savings` respond with 404 pages.
3. **Community missions missing** – `/community/missions` returns 404.
4. **Fundraising content absent** – `/fundraising` loads empty shell without campaigns.
5. **Support contact missing** – `/support` shows categories but lacks hotline/email details.
6. **Settings toggles non-functional** – Language, theme, and notification options are static bullets with no controls.

## Recommendations
- Implement the Insurance and Savings sub-pages or remove their links until content exists.
- Provide a fallback state for Rewards when API data fails and ensure the feed loads.
- Populate Fundraising and Rewards with live content or hide modules until services are ready.
- Add actionable contact information on `/support` to align with UX expectations.
- Enhance Settings with functional toggles for language, theme, and notification preferences.
- Track `/community/missions` roadmap to avoid exposed 404s, or hide the link until shipped.

## Test Notes
- Manual testing via text-based browser; dynamic media (video, chat, USSD flows) could not be exercised but navigation integrity was confirmed across exposed routes.
